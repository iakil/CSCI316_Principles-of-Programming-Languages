## HW 1: 

Here is a [link](https://replit.com/@JoshuaWaxman/DifferentEcstaticOrigin#main.py) [(alt)](https://github.com/iakil/CSCI316_Principles-of-Programming-Languages/ClassCode/DifferentEcstaticOrigin/) to my REPL:

There, you will find the following code (towards the bottom):

```python
def compute_area_circle():
    # put your name in a comment here
  
    # make definitions here
    radius:int = 0
 
    # get the radius using a function
 
    # processing using a function
    # output the area here by calling a function
 
    pass
compute_area_circle()

```

Create your own public REPL. (If you want, name the file hw1.py or something like that.) 
Start recording using Chrome DevTools Recorder tool. Copy the above code into the REPL.
Modify the code so it has your own name in the first comment. Also, after each of the subsequent comments, call a function. That function can either be a nested function (in which case you will likely have to use the nonlocal keyword to access radius and PI), or a function outside of compute_area_circle() (in which case you will likely have to use the global keyword to access radius and / or PI).

 To submit:
1) The Python file (ending in .py)
2) The link to your own REPL (as a comment, perhaps on the assignment if this is possible).
3) The exported JSON for your recording. (I'll be able to lightly edit it and then replay the recording myself.)
